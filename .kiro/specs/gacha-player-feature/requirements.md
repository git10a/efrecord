# Requirements Document

## Introduction

この機能は、現在の「Today's Epic Player」をソシャゲのガチャのような演出に変更し、ユーザーがボタンを押すことでランダムに選手を表示できるようにします。ユーザーごとに異なる選手が表示され、エンゲージメントを高める楽しい体験を提供します。

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to pull a gacha to get a random player, so that I can enjoy a game-like experience when discovering new players.

2. WHEN the user clicks the gacha button THEN the system SHALL show an animated gacha pulling effect

4. WHEN the same user pulls the gacha multiple times THEN the system SHALL show different random players each time

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see an exciting gacha animation, so that I feel the thrill similar to mobile game gacha systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN the gacha animation is playing THEN the system SHALL disable the gacha button to prevent multiple simultaneous pulls

4. WHEN the player is revealed THEN the system SHALL show the player information with enhanced visual presentation

### Requirement 3

2. WHEN a user pulls the gacha THEN the system SHALL use the user ID as part of the randomization seed
3. WHEN a user pulls the gacha multiple times THEN the system SHALL generate truly random results for each pull
4. WHEN the system selects a random player THEN it SHALL ensure all players in the database have equal probability of being selected

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to pull the gacha again, so that I can discover more players and enjoy the experience repeatedly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player is displayed after gacha pull THEN the system SHALL show a "Pull Again" button
2. WHEN the user clicks "Pull Again" THEN the system SHALL start a new gacha animation and select a new random player
3. WHEN the user pulls the gacha again THEN the system SHALL allow the same player to appear again (no duplicate prevention)
4. WHEN the gacha is being pulled THEN the system SHALL maintain the same animation and user experience as the first pull
