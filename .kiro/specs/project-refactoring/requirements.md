# Requirements Document

## Introduction

eF recordプロジェクトは現在、多数の散らばったSQLファイル、未使用のコード、整理されていないファイル構造により保守性が低下している。このリファクタリングプロジェクトは、コードベースを整理し、保守性を向上させ、開発効率を高めることを目的とする。

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clean and organized project structure, so that I can easily navigate and maintain the codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is examined THEN all SQL files SHALL be organized into appropriate directories
2. WHEN unused files are identified THEN they SHALL be removed from the project
3. WHEN the project structure is reviewed THEN it SHALL follow Next.js best practices

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove unused dependencies and code, so that the project remains lightweight and secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN package.json is analyzed THEN unused dependencies SHALL be identified and removed
2. WHEN code is scanned THEN unused imports and dead code SHALL be removed
3. WHEN the build process runs THEN it SHALL complete without warnings about unused dependencies

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent code formatting and structure, so that the codebase is maintainable and readable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN TypeScript files are reviewed THEN they SHALL follow consistent naming conventions
2. WHEN component files are examined THEN they SHALL be properly organized in logical directories
3. WHEN utility functions are reviewed THEN they SHALL be consolidated and properly typed

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper database migration management, so that database changes can be tracked and applied systematically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN SQL files are organized THEN migration files SHALL be separated from ad-hoc scripts
2. WHEN database setup is performed THEN it SHALL use a single, comprehensive setup script
3. WHEN database schema changes are made THEN they SHALL be tracked through proper migration files

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want improved type safety and error handling, so that the application is more robust and easier to debug.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN TypeScript types are reviewed THEN they SHALL be comprehensive and accurate
2. WHEN API calls are made THEN they SHALL have proper error handling
3. WHEN components are rendered THEN they SHALL handle loading and error states appropriately

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consolidated configuration files, so that project settings are centralized and easy to manage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuration files are reviewed THEN duplicate or conflicting settings SHALL be resolved
2. WHEN environment variables are used THEN they SHALL be properly documented
3. WHEN build tools are configured THEN they SHALL use optimal settings for development and production
